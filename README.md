# WarehouseWreckage

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

A project to teach myself Unreal, it's a game with some basic physics and UI that allows you to knock down a bunch of barrels. Still working on recognizing the win state.

## TODO

- build release and see that you can include it on Github releases without messing up the LFS thing
